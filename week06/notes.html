            <h2>Preface</h2>
                <p>
                    This weeek we studied Error and Exception Handling. 
                    It is important for us to handle to use these techniques when working with complicated wep applications.
                </p>
            <h2>Reading: Testing and Debugging</h2>
                <h3>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>System error - there is a problem with the system or external devices</li>
                        <li>Programmer error - program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic</li>
                        <li>User error - user entered the data wrong</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Exceptions</h3>
                    <p>
                        An error that produces a return value that can be used to deal with the error.
                         A non-existant method could result in a reference error -> and exception 
                        which will let the programmer know what is wrong.
                    </p>
                <h3>Stack Traces</h3>
                    <p>
                        A sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error took place, produced by an exception.
                        Stack trace works backward from the point where the error occurs to identify the origional function or method that started the sequence.
                        The following error was triggered by invoking function one() in the first place.
                    </p>
                    <script>
                        function three(){ unicorn(); }
                        function two(){ three(); }
                        function one(){ two(); }
                        one();
                    </script>
                <h3>Warnings</h3>
                    <p>
                        warnings are triggered when there is an issue which is not enough to crash the program. 
                        The program continues to run but the issue persists.
                    </p>
                    <script>
                        pi=3.142;
                    </script>
                    <p> 
                        when a runtime error occurs in the browser, the html continues but the JavaScript code ceases to function.
                        If a warning occurs, the JavaScript will continue to run.
                    </p>
                <h3>Importance of Testing and Debugging</h3>
                    <p>
                        Because JavaScript fails quietly it is easy to miss mistakes. Make sure that the code you write fails loudly.
                    </p>
                <h3>Strict Mode</h3>
                    <p>
                        'use strict'; is a a mode which forces the programmer to deal with mistakes early and often. 
                        It is the recommended means to write better quality JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <script>
                        'use strict';
                        e = 2.718;
                        function strictly(){'use strict';}
                        //this is the recommended way to write all JavaScript
                        (function() {
                            'use strict';
                            // All your code would go inside this function
                        }());
                    </script>
                <h3>Linting Tools</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Js Lint, JS Hint, Es Lint  can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond using strict mode.</li>
                        <li>They are designed to highlight sloppy programming practices or syntax errors.</li>
                        <li>They can be unforgiving and use some opinionated coding conventions, such as not using the ++ and -- increment operators.</li>
                        <li>You can use online linting tools and test-editor plugins. you can also use npm to install linting software</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Feature Detection</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can detect what features a browser supports using feature detection.
                        This is done using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to actually call the method.
                        the following is an example of this:
                    </p>
                    <script>
                        if (window.holoDeck) {
                            virtualReality.activate();
                        }
                    </script>
                    <p>
                        This makes sure that no errors occur if the browser doesn't support the method, referencing a nonexistant object such as window.virtualReality will return undefined.
                        Modernizer is a libray that offers an easy way to implement feature detection and Can I Use? is another useful resource for checking which featrures are currently supported.
                    </p>
