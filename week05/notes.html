                <h3>Forms</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Forms are places to in take input from the user</li>
                        <li>they include input fields, select menus and buttons.</li>
                        <li>The act of proceesing input from the user used to be soley handled in the backedn but it is now more common to be handled in the front end</li>
                        <li>Example:</li>
                        <form name='search' action='search'>
                            <input name='searchinput'>
                            <button type='submit'>Search</button>
                        </form>
                    </ul>>
                <h3>Accessing Form Elements</h3>
                    <ul> 
                        <li>DOM has a feature called document.forms[] that returns an html collection of all the forms in the documentin the order they appear in the markup </li>
                        <li>to accesss a specific form you can use index notation: const form = document.form[0];</li>
                        <li>This is the same as const form = document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0];</li>
                        <li> you can also use the "name" attribute to identify a form: const form = document.forms.search; will access the form created above.</li>
                        <li>const form = document.forms['search']; is a way to do this safely without calling two things at once</li>
                        <li>"A form object also has a method called elements that returns an HTML collection of all the elements contained in the form. In this case the form contains two controls: an input element and a button element:

                            const [input,button] = form.elements;
                            We can also access the form controls using their 'name' attributes as if it was a property of the form object. So, for example, the input field has a name attribute of searchInput and can be accessed using this code:
                            
                            const input = form.searchInput
                            The square bracket notation can also be used instead (again, this is useful if there are any naming clashes with existing property and method names, or if the name is an invalid variable name):
                            
                            const input = form['searchInput']"
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Form Properties and Methods</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>form.submit() will submit the form automatically</li>
                        <li>form.reset() will reset all the form controls back to their initial value</li>
                        <li>"Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data that’s been entered. So think very carefully before using one in a form."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
                    <input type='submit' value='Submit'>
                    <input type='image' src='Button.png'>
                    <button type='reset'>Reset</button>
                <h3>Form Events</h3>
                    <p>The focus event occurs when an element is focused on. In the case of an input element, this is when the cursor is placed inside the element (either by clicking or tapping on it or navigating to it using the keyboard). To see an example, add the following code to main.js :</p>
                    <p>const input = form.elements.searchInput;<br>input.addEventListener('focus', () => alert('focused'), false);</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The blur event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element. Add the following to main.js , reload the page, and then move the cursor away from the search box:</li>
                        <li>input.addEventListener('blur', () => alert('blurred'), false);</li>
                        <li>The change event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form elementafter changing it. So if a user clicks in an input field and makes no changes, and then clicks elsewhere, the change event won’t fire, but the blur event will.</li>
                        <li>input.addEventListener('change', () => alert('changed'), false);</li>
                        <li>Note that the blur event will also fire, but after the change event.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Submitting a Form</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Possibly the most important form event is the submit event, occurring when the form is submitted. Usually this will send the content of the form to the server to be processed, but we can use JavaScript to intercept the form before it’s sent by adding a submit event listener.</li>
                        <li>Now reload the page and click on theSubmitbutton. You should see an alert dialog sayingForm Submitted. After you clickOK, the browser tries to load a nonexistent page (the URL should end in something similar to '.../search?searchInput=hello'). This is because when the event fired, our search() function was invoked, displaying the alert dialog. Then the form was submitted to the URL provided in the 'action' attribute for processing, but in this case, the URL isn't a real URL, so it doesn't go anywhere. Back-end processing isn't covered in this book, so we'll keep this as a 'dummy' URL and focus on using JavaScript to process the information instead.</li> 
                    </ul>
                <h3>Retrieving and Changing Values From a Form</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>text input elements have a value property tied to them</li>
                        <li>the default text will disappear when the user clicks inside the input field (the focus event) and reappear if the user leaves the field blank and clicks away from it (the blur event).</li>
                        <li>input.value</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>placeholder Attribute</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Similar functionality can be produced in modern browsers using the placeholder attribute in the HTML markup. Simply change the input field to the following in search.html :</li>
                        <input type='text' name='search-box' placeholder='Search Here'>
                        <li>This works better than the javascript version if you with to avoid  default submissions</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Form Controls</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
        <script src='main.js'></script>
