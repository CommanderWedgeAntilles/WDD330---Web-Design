                <p>
                    This week I reviewed alot of javascript and html content which I needed refreshing on. 
                    I also read the readings and set up this index for use during the semester. 
                    The index.html is not being updated for the pages link. 
                    The display does not by any means represent what is found in the actual html file of the css/javascript files.
                </p>
            <h2>Practice from Readings</h2>
