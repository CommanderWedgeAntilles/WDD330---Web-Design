                    This week I reviewed alot of javascript and html content which I needed refreshing on. 
                    I also read the readings and set up this index for use during the semester. 
                    Overall It has been a good experiance but I could really use a response to question I emailed to you. 
                    I'm unable to use the github pages feature for my repository. Git's forcing me to pay a monthly fee if I want it to functionas intended.
                    Do you know why this is?
