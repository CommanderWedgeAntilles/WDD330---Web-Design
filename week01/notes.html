            <h2>Preface</h2>
                <p>
                    This week I reviewed alot of javascript and html content which I needed refreshing on. 
                    I also read the readings and set up this index for use during the semester. 
                    Where is template.html? I can't find it in the links from the text.
                </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            One of my roomates is relaxing.
                            They do this after work because their job is super stressful. 
                            They reach out to their friends and invite them to play games online with them.
                            They lose track of time easily and get little sleep. 
                            Not getting enough sleep results in another bad day  because they had so little sleep. 
                            They play games late at night again in a cycle.
                            
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Stress and time goes in, the Relaxing function occurs requiring and absorbing time to decrease stress.
                            Time is also required to Sleep. Sleep decreases Stress dramatically.
                            Work is a function that requires sleep to avoid increasing Stress and requires time.
                            Time is a limited variable. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
